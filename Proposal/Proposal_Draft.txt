Project Proposal Draft Doc:

-> Still not complete: Bake 5 questions into proposal into proper project.
-> Current areas of interest: Forbidden Minors, Theoretically Bounded Genus, Use of Facial Cycles

1. Background and Basics (Problem Statement)

- Fundamentals of Topological Graph Theory
- GAO 14-16
- Genus, Surfaces, Orientability, Euler Characteric, Faces, etc.

2. Literature

- See Doc
- Order Chronologically
- Divided into theory (complexity theory, pure math), algorithms and applications (if any are discussed)

3. Areas of Investigation

  Focus on the 5 questions:
    - Forbidden Minors: Can Forbidden Minor Theory (ie: extension of Kuratowski's theorem) provide tools for bounding a graph's genus?
    - Facial Cycles: Can a combinatorial embedding of a graph be provided in lieu of a rendered embedding? Are these equivalent?
    - Fixed Parameters: Given a graph G with a surface S of genus Q, does an embedding E of G on S exist? Investigate literature here.
    - Approximation: Can the genus of a graph Q be approximated to some acceptable error margin? Are these approximations verifiable? Can they be used to bound the genus instead?
    - Orientability: How do problems (and solutions) in graph embedding change with respect to the (lack of) orientability of the surface in question? Different Euler characteristic. Other different properties?

3. Proposed Contributions

- Bound graph genus to allow for checking with Filotti 1979. Use Forbidden Minors and other approaches
- Orientability options for a graph's embedding
- Instead of showing embedding, show a graph is possible with F faces?
- Other new mathematical/theoretical means for bounding or approximating genus
- Big question: There exists a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for the graph genus problem. If the genus of a graph can be bounded in P, then is the graph genus problem in P? Even if this is incorrect or misguided, it's worth looking into.

5. Programming

- Forbidden Minor to bound graph genus. Goal: Bounded and Approximated Genus
- Implement at least one existing alg, perhaps Fibotti 1979 or something newer. Goal: Grasp and Evaluate existing literature
- Edmonds 1960 (Rotation System) on other surfaces. Goal: Study feasibility of (4)(c)
