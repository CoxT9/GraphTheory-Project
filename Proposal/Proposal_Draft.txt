Project Proposal Draft Doc:

-> Current areas of interest: Forbidden Minors, Theoretically Bounded Genus, Use of Facial Cycles

> read Filotti and read Thomassen then write. 
1. Background and Basics (Problem Statement)

- Fundamentals of Topological Graph Theory
- GAO 14-16
- Genus, Surfaces, Orientability, Euler Characteric, Faces, etc.

2. Literature

- See Doc
- Order Chronologically
- Divided into theory (complexity theory, pure math), algorithms and applications (if any are discussed)

3. Areas of Investigation

  Focus on the 5 questions:
    - Forbidden Minors: Can Forbidden Minor Theory (ie: extension of Kuratowski's theorem) provide tools for bounding a graph's genus?
    - Facial Cycles: Can a combinatorial embedding of a graph be provided in lieu of a rendered embedding? Are these equivalent?
    - Fixed Parameters: Given a graph G with a surface S of genus Q, does an embedding E of G on S exist? Investigate literature here.
    - Approximation: Can the genus of a graph Q be approximated to some acceptable error margin? Are these approximations verifiable? Can they be used to bound the genus instead?
    - Orientability: How do problems (and solutions) in graph embedding change with respect to the (lack of) orientability of the surface in question? Different Euler characteristic. Other different properties?

3. Proposed Contributions

- Bound graph genus to allow for checking with Filotti 1979. Use Forbidden Minors and other approaches
- Orientability options for a graph's embedding
- Instead of showing embedding, show a graph is possible with F faces?
- Other new mathematical/theoretical means for bounding or approximating genus
- Big question: There exists a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for the graph genus problem. If the genus of a graph can be bounded in P, then is the graph genus problem in P? Even if this is incorrect or misguided, it's worth looking into.

5. Programming

- Forbidden Minor to bound graph genus. Goal: Bounded and Approximated Genus
- Implement at least one existing alg, perhaps Fibotti 1979 or something newer. Goal: Grasp and Evaluate existing literature
- Edmonds 1960 (Rotation System) on other surfaces. Goal: Study feasibility of (4)(c)

> Graph genus is NP Complete
> People tried to give fixed param algs
> These algs were flawed
> However, at least one is not
> Goal of project: Heuristics to bound genus of G to feed into fixed param alg

Intro:
- What is it
- The story (briefly)
- Contribute heuristics: Faces, forbidden minors, theory

Problem:
- Formally define the problem, 2 cell embeddings, contractibility, j-curves, ..., then get into embedding, where it is, what the problem is.

Related Work:
- use the doc. tell the story. capture relevant work to heuristic development

Investigation:
- minors, faces, theory

Contributions:
- Heurustic to cut options for genus away. Run G through to see if it contains certain minors? See how many faces G has? other options

Programming:
- code to detect forbidden minors
- code to find all the faces? what benefit does facial cycles give?
- code to give an embedding?
