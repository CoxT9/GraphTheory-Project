Project Proposal Draft Doc:

-> Still not complete: Bake 5 questions into proposal into proper project.
-> Current areas of interest: Forbidden Minors, Theoretically Bounded Genus, Use of Facial Cycles

1. Background and Basics (Problem Statement)

- Fundamentals of Topological Graph Theory
- GAO 14-16
- Genus, Surfaces, Orientability, Euler Characteric, Faces, etc.

2. Literature

- See Doc
- Order Chronologically
- Divided into theory (complexity theory, pure math), algorithms and applications (if any are discussed)

3. Insights and Conjectures

- Forbidden Minor Theorem
- Usage of Faces/Facial Cycles
- Theoretical Bounds (Triangulations, 0-Faces rule)

4. Proposed Contributions

- Bound graph genus to allow for checking with Filotti 1979
- Orientability options for a graph's embedding
- Instead of showing embedding, show a graph is possible with F faces?

5. Programming

- Forbidden Minor to bound graph genus. Goal: Bounded and Approximated Genus
- Implement at least one existing alg, perhaps Fibotti 1979 or something newer. Goal: Grasp and Evaluate existing literature
- Edmonds 1960 (Rotation System) on other surfaces. Goal: Study feasibility of (4)(c)
