Comments on the '5 Questions':

1. Is there a variant of Kuratowski's theorem for surfaces of genus != 0?

- This would be "A graph can be embedded on the __ iff it has no minor __"
- May be useful to look at K5, K33 on the double torus: Maximal genus
- This is actually an area of area research: Forbidden Minor theory

2. What algorithms exist to find all facial cycles of a graph?

- Edmonds 1960
- GAO chapter 14/15
- Schneider 2015 (Planar)

3. What algorithms exist to approximate or bound the genus of a graph?

- Read GAO chapter 15
- Use Euler Characteristic and Related formulas (ie: can't have 0 faces)
- Beyond The Graph Genus

4. How do the rules for determining if a graph embedding is possibile differ between orientable and non-orientable surfaces?

- Different Genus formulas for each type of surface
- GAO chapter 15/16
- Non orientable genus N is same as a sphere with N cross caps

5. What theory exists for showing an embedding exists for some graph G on some surface S?

- 1979 Algorithm in O(n^O(g)) time
- If number of faces possible, graph May exist
- Can also use combinatorial mapping (Edmonds 1960) here
