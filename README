This repository captures the project work accomplished during COMP 4060/7750 Winter 2018: Graph Theory. 

This project is focused on problems relating to Graph Embedding on different surfaces of interest. In particular, the goal of this project is to ask questions such as the following:

Given a graph G and a surface S of genus Q, does an embedding (with no crossings) exist of G on S?
Does such an embedding need to be explicity given in order to conclude that such an embedding exists?
Given a graph G, can the genus Q of G be bounded minimally and/or maximally?
What interesting properties do Orientable and Non-orientable surfaces share (or not) with respect to graph embedding?
What other aspects of Graph Theory (Forbidden Minors, Facial Cycles, among others) can be used to break new ground in this problem?
And more...
