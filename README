This repository captures the project work accomplished during COMP 4060/7750 Winter 2018: Graph Theory. 

This project is focused on a problem prerequisite to graph embedding and other graph-theoretic problems concerning minor-closed properties. The problem of interest is the graph minor problem:

"Given a graph G and a fixed minor H, does G have a minor H?"

The first algorithm to answer to this question was given by Robertson and Seymour in 1995 with an O(n3) algorithm which has impractical dependence on large constants. Kawarabayashi then proposed a O(n2) algorithm in 2009, followed by a O(nm) algorithm in 2010 (where m is the number of edges). Kawarabayashi's algorithms are thought to be much more efficient.

This project will include the following:
1. Implementation of Kawarabayashi's O(nm) algorithm
2. Practical and Theoretical comparison against the only other known implementation (the one on Sage)
3. Discussion of impact of the graph minor algorithm (particularly, contributions to complexity theory)
